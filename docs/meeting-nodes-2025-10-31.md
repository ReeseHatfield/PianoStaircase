# Meeting Notes October 31st, 2025

## Key Decisions

- 1 Raspberry Pi per stair
    - This give us additional flexibility interfacing with different sensors
    - This should still be well within budget 
    - Can scale down into lower Pi models if need be
    - Can communicate well via web server

- Time of Flight sensors
    - We already have a prototype
    - See Dopamine Machine
    - Should support the range we need

- User Interface
    - We can also use a separate Pi to run the user Interface
    - At previous meeting, the software team decided on using python + flask for display and communication
    - This should easily communicate with the other Pi, via HTTP, or another protocol

- Working budget
    - $5,000 USD


## Actions Taken
- Software team mostly out today
- Hardware team began work on prototyping 1-pi-per-stair model
